# About
This project implements a P-controller on a SITL simulation of an ardurover to follow a set of waypoints. <br/>

The simulation can be setup using this link: http://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/rover-sitlmavproxy-tutorial.html <br/>

The proportional gain was tuned to prevent rapid changes in the bot's orientation. Below is the video showing the p-controller running on the simulated rover: <br/>
